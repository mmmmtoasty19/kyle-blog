# Shiny Apps

-   [COVID Explorer](https://kyleb.shinyapps.io/covid-explorer/)

    - Note this is no longer in active development so the data is quite stale

-   [NYPD CCRB](https://kyleb.shinyapps.io/nypd-ccrb-2020-shiny/)

    - This App was created quickly to show of data exploration of a particular data set for a Grant application.  The App shows how leaflet can be used to create a map and some of the interactions with it.
