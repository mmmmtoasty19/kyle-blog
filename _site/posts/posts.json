I have been learning R off and on now since late 2019, I have begun to take it much more serious as I work through my Data Analytics class at UCF. My love for all things numbers and graphs has really blossomed, and I am choosing to share that love with anyone who cares to read. I will not claim to be the best at R, or any programming for that matter, but these are my attempts. Each post in this serious will be replicated a graph created in Tableau from the book Tableau for Healthcare. Todays graph is a simple horizontal bar chart, in transferring to both a new blog site and computer I have unfortunately lost the original bar graph, but trust me the one I created looks just like it.\r\nLoad Libraries\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(tidyr)\r\nlibrary(magrittr)\r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\r\nlibrary(stringr)\r\nlibrary(dplyr)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImport Data\r\n\r\n\r\nds <- readxl::read_excel(\r\n    path   = \"Tableau 10 Training Practice Data.xlsx\" \r\n    ,sheet = \"02 - Patient Falls-Single Hosp\"\r\n    )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClean Data Names\r\n\r\n\r\n#should make reusable forumla at later time\r\nnames(ds) <- tolower(names(ds))\r\nnames(ds) <- str_replace_all(names(ds),\" \", \"_\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConvert Data to ‘Long Form’\r\n\r\n\r\nds1 <- ds %>% \r\n  gather(\"patient_falls_no_injury_rate\" , \"patient_falls_with_injury_rate\"\r\n         ,key   = \"injury\" \r\n         ,value = \"rate\" ) %>% \r\n  mutate(injury = (injury == \"patient_falls_with_injury_rate\"))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGraph 5.1\r\n\r\n\r\nb1 <- ds %>% \r\n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = reorder(type_of_care,total_patient_falls_rate ) , y = total_patient_falls_rate)) +\r\n  geom_col(fill = \"#2b83ba\") + \r\n  coord_flip() +\r\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = NULL) +\r\n  theme(axis.ticks = element_blank()) +\r\n  labs(title = \"Rate of Patient Falls (per 1,000 Pateint Days)\\nby Type of Care for FY2017\"\r\n      ,x     = NULL\r\n      ,y     = NULL\r\n      ) +\r\n  theme_classic() +\r\n  geom_text(aes(label = format(total_patient_falls_rate, digits = 2)), nudge_y = -.25, color = \"white\")\r\n  \r\nb1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
